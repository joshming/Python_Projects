# Python Projects
Some python work from university

## a1 \
a1's main purpose was to develop a club-finding program for students. \
Student names and information were to be in a text file, which would be read by the program. Based on their friends and current clubs, they would be recommended some other club that the algorithm believed would be a good fit for them. \
